# 🔒 Localhost Vulnerability Assessment using Greenbone OpenVAS

## 🧩 Overview  
This project documents a hands-on vulnerability assessment conducted on a Kali Linux machine using **Greenbone OpenVAS (GVM)**.  
The goal was to identify, analyze, and mitigate potential security risks on the local system.

---

## ⚙️ Process  
1. **Installed & configured** Greenbone OpenVAS on Kali Linux.  
2. **Set up scan target** for `localhost (127.0.0.1)`.  
3. Executed a **“Full and Fast”** vulnerability scan.  
4. **Reviewed** and analyzed the generated vulnerability report.  
5. **Documented key findings** with screenshots and remediation steps.

## 🧾 Key Findings  
- Identified **critical** and **high-severity** vulnerabilities.  
- Included system configuration and software-related issues.  
- Highlighted risks affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  

---

## 🛠️ Recommendations  
- Apply software and OS **security patches**.  
- Remove or update **deprecated packages**.  
- Configure **stronger authentication** and service restrictions.  
- Regularly **run vulnerability scans** to maintain system security.

---

## 🎯 Outcome  
- Improved understanding of **vulnerability management**.  
- Enhanced system **security awareness**.  
- Developed hands-on skills in **OpenVAS scanning and reporting**.
